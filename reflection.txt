1. Effects of P, I and D
P term tries to reduce CTE based on a linear relationship.
D term can help reduce the oscilications caused by the P term.
I term will help reduce the sum of CTE over the entire running horizon.
The properties of the gains are aligned with the observations during tuning.

2. The final PID parameters are obtained through manual tuning.
To begin with, all P, I and D terms are set to 0.
Then P term is tuned to achieve a reasonable tracking performance with certain osciliations.
Next, D term is tuned to reduce the oscilation.
At last, a small I term is added to further reduce the overall CTE, especially for the sharp turn.
